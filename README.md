### Next Development Phase

1. **Extended Database**: Add upload links, files metadata schemas (Task 10)
2. **Core Features**: File upload system with UploadThing integration (Task 12)
3. **Link Management**: Custom upload links with expiration (Task 13)
4. **E2E Testing**: Playwright setup for full user workflows (Task 11)

> **Current Focus**: See [TASK.md](docs/TASK.md) for Task 10 (Advanced Database Setup)

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategy

**Monthly Operating Costs (Projected)**:

- **MVP Stage**: ~$40/month (Vercel + Neon + basic services)
- **Growth Stage**: ~$150/month (scaled services)
- **Target Revenue**: $2,450/month by month 6

**Key Cost Optimizations**:

- Serverless-first architecture (pay-per-use)
