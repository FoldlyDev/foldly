// REACT QUERY KEYS - Centralized Query Key Factory
// =============================================================================
// ðŸŽ¯ Single source of truth for all React Query cache keys
// Following React Query best practices for key structure and organization

// Key Structure Pattern:
// - ['entity'] - all entities
// - ['entity', 'list'] - list of entities
// - ['entity', 'detail', id] - specific entity
// - ['entity', 'operation', params] - specific operation
