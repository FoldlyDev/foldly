# Files Feature Development Progress

> **Started**: January 2025  
> **Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
> **Architecture**: Domain-driven design following links feature patterns  
> **Store Pattern**: Multiple focused Zustand stores with pure reducers

## 📋 Task Progress

### ✅ Completed Tasks

- [x] **files-types** - Comprehensive TypeScript types (branded types, enums, interfaces)
- [x] **files-architecture** - Feature structure and directory organization
- [x] **Basic Components** - Initial FilesContainer and page setup
- [x] **files-constants** - Complete constants and configuration (374 lines)
- [x] **files-utils** - Comprehensive utility functions for file operations
  - [x] **mock-data.ts** - 8 sample files, 6 folders, workspace data, initialization functions
  - [x] **file-operations.ts** - File validation, formatting, search, sorting, thumbnails
  - [x] **file-tree.ts** - Tree creation, manipulation, traversal, statistics
  - [x] **index.ts** - Barrel exports for all utilities

### 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] **files-store** - Create Zustand store for file management with mock data
- [ ] **files-store** - Create Zustand store for file management with mock data
- [ ] **files-hooks** - Create composite hooks for file operations
- [ ] **files-components** - Build file cards, folder views, and drag-drop components
- [ ] **files-services** - Implement file operations services
- [ ] **files-views** - Create container views and workspace management
- [ ] **files-styles** - Add feature-specific styles for files

## 🏗️ Architecture Plan

### **Store Architecture** (Following Links Pattern)

```typescript
// Multiple focused stores
useFilesDataStore; // CRUD operations and data management
useFilesUIStore; // UI state (view, search, filters, selection)
useFilesModalStore; // Modal state management
useFilesWorkspaceStore; // Workspace and folder management
```

### **Composite Hooks** (Eliminate Prop Drilling)

```typescript
useFileCardStore(fileId); // Individual file card state
useFilesListStore(); // List management state
useFilesModalsStore(); // Modal management state
useFilesWorkspaceStore(); // Workspace and folder operations
useFilesDragDropStore(); // Drag & drop functionality
```

### **Directory Structure**

## 🎯 Key Features to Implement

### **Core File Management**

- [ ] File upload with drag & drop
- [ ] File preview and thumbnails
- [ ] File organization (rename, move, delete)
- [ ] File sharing and permissions
- [ ] File search and filtering

### **Workspace Management**

- [ ] Folder creation and management
- [ ] Folder colors and icons
- [ ] Drag & drop file organization
- [ ] Workspace views (grid, list, tree)
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation

### **Advanced Features**

- [ ] Multi-file operations (batch actions)
- [ ] File versioning and history
- [ ] File collaboration
- [ ] File analytics and insights
- [ ] File backup and sync

## 🔄 Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Current)

1. ✅ TypeScript types and interfaces
2. 🚧 Constants and configuration
3. 🚧 Utility functions and mock data
4. 🚧 Store architecture implementation

### **Phase 2: Core Components**

1. File and folder cards
2. File upload components
3. Modal components
4. Workspace views

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

1. Drag & drop functionality
2. File operations services
3. Search and filtering
4. File sharing and permissions

### **Phase 4: Polish & Testing**

1. Comprehensive testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Accessibility improvements
4. Documentation updates

## 📊 Technical Decisions

### **State Management**

- **Multiple Zustand stores** for separation of concerns
- **Pure reducer pattern** for testable business logic
- **Composite hooks** to eliminate prop drilling
- **Real-time sync** across components

### **File Handling**

- **Mock data** for development and testing
- **Generic placeholder images** for file previews
- **File type detection** based on extensions and MIME types
- **Drag & drop** using HTML5 API with React integration

### **Performance**

- **Granular subscriptions** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Memoized selectors** for stable references
- **Virtualization** for large file lists
- **Lazy loading** for file previews

## 🐛 Known Issues

- None currently identified

## 📝 Notes

- Following [Zustand architecture patterns at scale](https://brainhub.eu/library/zustand-architecture-patterns-at-scale)
- Using same patterns as successful links feature migration
- Maintaining 2025 React + TypeScript best practices
- Ensuring full type safety with strict configuration

## 🔄 Recent Updates
