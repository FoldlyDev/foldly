## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture Decision**

### **Chosen Approach: Modern Full-Stack Next.js Application**

We're building a **modular monolith** using Next.js - this is the **industry-recommended approach** for SaaS startups in 2025.

#### **Why This Architecture is Professional & Optimal:**

**‚úÖ Industry Validation:**

- **Netflix, Linear, Vercel**: Started with similar architectures
- **Martin Fowler's "Monolith First"**: Start modular, extract services only when needed
- **2025 Best Practice**: Right-sized architecture for team and business stage

**‚úÖ Business Benefits:**

- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Single codebase, unified development
- **Lower Operating Costs**: $40/month (MVP) vs $200+ for microservices
- **Easier Maintenance**: One deployment, simplified operations
- **Team Efficiency**: One developer can handle full-stack development

**‚úÖ Technical Advantages:**

- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript prevents integration bugs
- **Scalability**: Can handle 10,000+ users without architectural changes
- **Evolution Path**: Can extract services when business justifies complexity

#### **External Services Integration (Not Building Everything):**

- **Authentication**: Clerk (industry standard)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (managed, auto-scaling)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 + CloudFront (global delivery)
- **Payments**: Stripe (industry leader)
