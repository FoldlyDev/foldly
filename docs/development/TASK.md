#### **⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITY: User Deletion Webhook Implementation**

- **Status**: 🔥 **URGENT** - Required for Production Robustness
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL**
- **Timeline**: 1-2 hours
- **Description**: Implement user deletion webhook to maintain database integrity when users are deleted from Clerk

##### **Implementation Requirements**

- **Task 1**: Create User Deletion Webhook Endpoint
  - [ ] **Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/clerk/user-deleted`
  - [ ] **Validation**: Verify Clerk webhook signature
  - [ ] **Processing**: Handle `user.deleted` event type
  - [ ] **Cleanup**: Cascade delete user data (workspace, files, links, folders)
  - [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with proper logging
  - [ ] **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate deletion events safely

- **Task 2**: Database Cleanup Service
  - [ ] **User Data Removal**: Delete user record and all associated data
  - [ ] **Cascade Logic**: Remove workspaces, links, files, folders, batches
  - [ ] **Foreign Key Handling**: Respect referential integrity constraints
  - [ ] **Audit Logging**: Log deletion events for compliance
  - [ ] **Soft Delete Option**: Consider soft delete for data recovery needs

- **Task 3**: Webhook Configuration
  - [ ] **Clerk Dashboard**: Enable user deletion webhook events
  - [ ] **Environment Setup**: Configure webhook endpoint URL
  - [ ] **Testing**: Verify webhook delivery and processing
  - [ ] **Monitoring**: Add deletion event tracking and alerts

##### **Technical Implementation**

```typescript
// Example webhook endpoint structure
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // 1. Verify Clerk webhook signature
    const verification = await validateClerkWebhook(request);
    if (!verification.success) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
    }

    // 2. Extract user deletion event
    const { type, data } = verification.data;
    if (type !== 'user.deleted') {
      return new Response('Event not handled', { status: 200 });
    }

    // 3. Cascade delete user data
    await userDeletionService.deleteUserData(data.id);

    return new Response('User data deleted', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('User deletion webhook failed:', error);
    return new Response('Internal server error', { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

##### **Database Cleanup Strategy**

1. **Transaction-based Deletion**: Ensure atomicity of cleanup operations
2. **Cascade Order**: Delete in proper order (files → folders → batches → links → workspaces → users)
3. **Storage Cleanup**: Remove uploaded files from Supabase Storage
4. **Audit Trail**: Log deletion events for compliance and debugging
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle partial failures gracefully

##### **Business Impact**

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents orphaned records when users delete accounts
- **Storage Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of unused files and data
- **Compliance**: Proper data deletion for GDPR and privacy regulations
- **User Experience**: Clean account deletion process without residual data
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced storage costs from automatic cleanup
