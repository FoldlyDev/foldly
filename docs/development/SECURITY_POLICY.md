// User Role Hierarchy
enum UserRole {
  USER = 'user', // Standard file upload access
  PREMIUM = 'premium', // Enhanced features access
  ADMIN = 'admin', // Full platform administration
  SUPER_ADMIN = 'super_admin', // System-level access
}

// Permission Matrix
const permissions = {
  user: ['upload:create', 'files:view_own', 'links:create_basic'],
  premium: ['upload:unlimited', 'files:view_own', 'links:create_branded'],
  admin: ['users:manage', 'analytics:view', 'system:configure'],
  super_admin: ['*'], // All permissions
};
```

## 🛡️ **Data Protection & Encryption**

### **Encryption Standards**

#### **Data at Rest**

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Key Management**: Supabase managed encryption keys with rotation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with column-level encryption for sensitive data
- **File Storage**: Encrypted storage with Supabase Storage

#### **Data in Transit**

- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL certificate renewal
- **API Security**: HTTPS-only with HSTS headers
- **WebSocket Security**: Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

#### **Key Management**

- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential storage
- **API Keys**: Rotation policy every 90 days
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWT tokens (15 minutes)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Secure storage with rotation

### **Data Classification & Handling**

```typescript
// Data Classification Levels
enum DataClassification {
  PUBLIC = 'public', // Marketing content
  INTERNAL = 'internal', // Business operations data
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'confidential', // User personal data
  RESTRICTED = 'restricted', // Payment & security data
}

// Handling Requirements by Classification
const handlingRequirements = {
  public: { encryption: false, logging: 'basic', retention: '1 year' },
  internal: { encryption: true, logging: 'standard', retention: '3 years' },
  confidential: { encryption: true, logging: 'enhanced', retention: '7 years' },

    H --> I[Database Recording]
    I --> J[Audit Log Entry]
    J --> K[Success Response]
```

#### **File Upload Security Controls**

1. **Pre-Upload Validation**
   - File type whitelist enforcement
   - File size limits per user tier
   - Filename sanitization
   - MIME type verification
   - **Real-time Size Validation**: Immediate feedback when files exceed plan limits

2. **Upload Process Security**
   - Virus and malware scanning
   - Content-based file type detection
   - Encrypted transmission (TLS 1.3)
   - Progress monitoring with real-time updates
   - **Real-time Quota Validation**: Pre-upload quota checking via database functions
   - **Plan-Based Enforcement**: File size limits enforced by subscription tier

3. **Post-Upload Processing**
   - Automatic thumbnail generation (images)
   - Metadata extraction and storage
   - File integrity verification
   - Backup creation for critical files

### **File Size Validation as Security Measure**

The platform implements comprehensive file size validation as both a security and resource management measure:

#### **Real-time Validation Benefits**

1. **Abuse Prevention**: Prevents users from uploading files larger than their plan allows
2. **Resource Protection**: Protects platform resources from excessive storage usage
3. **User Awareness**: Immediate feedback prevents frustration from failed uploads
4. **Clear Communication**: Detailed error messages show exactly which files are too large

#### **Plan-Based Limits**

```typescript
const FILE_SIZE_LIMITS = {
  free: 10 * 1024 * 1024,      // 10 MB
  pro: 100 * 1024 * 1024,      // 100 MB
  business: 500 * 1024 * 1024, // 500 MB
};
```

#### **Enhanced Error Messaging**

When file size limits are exceeded, users receive detailed feedback:

- **Specific File Information**: Shows file names and their actual sizes
- **Plan Context**: Indicates the user's current plan and its limit
- **Multiple File Handling**: Lists up to 3 problematic files with a count of additional ones
- **Actionable Guidance**: Clear indication of what needs to be done (remove files or upgrade plan)

### **Storage Infrastructure Security** - Production Ready ✅

**Supabase Storage Buckets**:

Two secure storage buckets with comprehensive access control and RLS policies:

#### **workspace-files** (Private Bucket)
- **Access Control**: Owner-only access via RLS policies
- **File Size Limit**: 100MB per file
- **Security**: Full encryption at rest and in transit
- **Use Case**: Private user files and workspace content
- **RLS Policy**: Users can only access their own files

#### **shared-files** (Public Bucket)
- **Access Control**: Public read access, controlled write access
- **File Size Limit**: 100MB per file
- **Security**: Encrypted storage with public read permissions
- **Use Case**: Files shared via public upload links
- **RLS Policy**: Authenticated uploads, public downloads

**Storage RLS Implementation**:

```sql
-- Private workspace files access control
CREATE POLICY "workspace_files_owner_access" ON storage.objects
  FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'workspace-files' AND owner = auth.uid()::text);

-- Public files with controlled uploads
CREATE POLICY "shared_files_public_read" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'shared-files');

CREATE POLICY "shared_files_authenticated_upload" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'shared-files' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### **File Access Control**

#### **Secure File Delivery**

- **Presigned URLs**: Time-limited access with expiration
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit trail for file access
- **CDN Security**: Secure content delivery with edge caching
- **Download Throttling**: Rate limiting for file downloads

#### **File Retention Policy**

```typescript
// File Retention Rules
const retentionPolicies = {
  free_tier: { retention: '30 days', cleanup: 'automatic' },
  pro_tier: { retention: '1 year', cleanup: 'manual' },
  enterprise: { retention: '7 years', cleanup: 'policy_based' },
};

// Automatic Cleanup Process
const cleanupRules = {
  expired_links: 'delete_after_7_days',
  abandoned_uploads: 'delete_after_24_hours',
  deleted_accounts: 'purge_after_30_days',
};
```
