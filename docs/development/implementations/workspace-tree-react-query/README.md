# React Query Workspace Tree Implementation

## Overview

This implementation modernizes the workspace tree component by integrating React Query with server actions to fetch real database data, replacing the previous mock data approach. The solution provides real-time updates, optimistic UI updates, and robust error handling while maintaining all existing drag-and-drop functionality.

## Key Features

- **Real Database Integration**: Fetches actual files and folders from the database
- **React Query Integration**: Leverages React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Drag & Drop Persistence**: All drag-and-drop operations now persist to the database
- **Advanced Batch Operations**: Move and delete multiple items with intelligent nested content handling
- **Smart Loading States**: Complete operation overlays with real-time progress tracking and status updates
- **Nested Content Management**: Proper handling of folders containing nested folders and files
- **Selection Mode**: Multi-select functionality with checkbox interface for batch operations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with automatic rollback on errors
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization of workspace changes across sessions
- **Internal Notifications**: Success and error notifications for user actions
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Problem Solved

### Before

- Workspace tree used hardcoded mock data
- No database persistence for tree operations
- No real-time updates
- Limited error handling
- Disconnected from actual workspace state

### After

- Real database data with React Query caching
- Full persistence of all tree operations
- Real-time synchronization across sessions
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Seamless integration with workspace server actions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- React Query must be configured in your app
- Workspace server actions must be available
- Internal notifications system must be set up

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { WorkspaceTree } from '@/features/workspace/components/tree/WorkspaceTree';

function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="workspace-layout">
      <WorkspaceTree />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **UI Layer**: `WorkspaceTree` component with loading states
2. **Data Layer**: `useWorkspaceTree` hook for React Query integration
3. **Business Logic**: Server actions for database operations
4. **Persistence**: Database operations with optimistic updates
