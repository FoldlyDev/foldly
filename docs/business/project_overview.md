# Foldly - Advanced Multi-Link File Collection Platform

> **Project Status**: 🚀 **Production Ready** - Feature-Based Architecture Implemented  
> **Architecture**: Modern Next.js Full-Stack Application with Advanced Multi-Link System  
> **Last Updated**: January 2025

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Foldly** is a next-generation SaaS platform that revolutionizes file collection through **advanced multi-link architecture**, **intelligent organization**, and **enterprise-grade security**. Built with 2025's latest technologies and best practices, Foldly provides a frictionless experience for both file requesters and uploaders.

### **Core Innovation: Multi-Link Architecture**

#### **Three Link Types for Every Use Case**

1. **Base Links**: `foldly.com/username`
   - **Purpose**: General data collection area
   - **UX**: Zero friction, name-only requirement
   - **Organization**: Auto-batch creation with smart grouping
   - **Security**: Recipient-configurable (email, password optional)

2. **Custom Topic Links**: `foldly.com/username/topic`
   - **Purpose**: Project-specific file collection
   - **UX**: Context-aware upload with topic-specific instructions
   - **Organization**: Auto-route to designated folders
   - **Security**: Per-topic permission controls

3. **Generated Links**: Right-click folder creation
   - **Purpose**: Targeted uploads for specific folders
   - **UX**: Direct folder assignment with clear context
   - **Organization**: Immediate folder placement
   - **Security**: Inherits folder permissions

#### **Advanced Organization System**

- **Pre-Upload Organization**: Uploaders can create folder structures
- **Intelligent Batching**: `[Uploader Name] (Batch Name) [Date]` format
- **Post-Upload Management**: Full reorganization capabilities
- **Workflow**: Recipients drag files to personal workspace before organizing
- **Auto-Sorting**: Custom links route to designated locations

#### **Flexible Security Controls**

- **Progressive Security**: Minimal friction by default, enhanced on demand
- **Granular Controls**: Per-link email requirements, password protection
- **Visibility Management**: Public/private settings per link or folder
- **Access Auditing**: Complete audit trail with security logging
