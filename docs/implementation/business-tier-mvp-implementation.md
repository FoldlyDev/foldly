# Business Tier MVP Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive fixes for Business tier display issues across the application, ensuring consistent "Coming Soon" UI states for MVP launch restrictions.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Business Tier Visibility

- **Problem**: Business tier was not appearing consistently across landing page and billing page
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent filtering logic between components and missing MVP status handling
- **Solution**: Updated filtering logic to include all active tiers, added proper MVP status checks

### 2. ✅ Landing Page Pricing Section

- **Location**: `src/features/landing/components/sections/pricing-section.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `isComingSoon` prop to `PricingCard` component
  - Implemented "Coming Soon" badge display for Business tier
  - Updated CTA button to show "Available Q2 2025" for MVP-restricted tiers
  - Modified tier filtering to include Business tier with MVP status
  - Added proper visual styling (opacity reduction for coming soon tiers)

### 3. ✅ Billing Page Consistency

- **Location**: `src/features/billing/components/pricing/PricingPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated button text from "Not Available During MVP Launch" to "Available Q2 2025"
  - Enhanced badge logic to prevent Popular badge from showing on Coming Soon tiers
  - Added opacity styling for MVP-restricted tiers
  - Fixed tier scaling logic for proper visual hierarchy

### 4. ✅ Database Schema Enhancement

- **Location**: `src/lib/database/schemas/subscription-tiers.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Business tier already configured with proper MVP status in features
  - Added `mvpStatus: 'not_available_during_mvp'` to Business tier default config
  - Updated description to include "(Coming Soon)" messaging

### 5. ✅ Type Safety Improvements

- **Location**: `src/features/billing/types/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `mvpStatus` field to `SubscriptionFeatures` interface
  - Added `popular` field as optional boolean
  - Enhanced type safety for MVP status handling

## Key Features Implemented

### Coming Soon UI State

- **Visual Indicators**: Orange "Coming Soon" badge on Business tier cards
- **Button States**: Disabled buttons with "Available Q2 2025" messaging
- **Styling**: Reduced opacity (90%) for coming soon tiers
- **Consistency**: Same treatment across landing page and billing dashboard

### MVP Launch Restrictions

- **Business Tier Visibility**: Shows in both landing and billing pages
- **Upgrade Prevention**: Upgrade logic blocks Business tier selection during MVP
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand tier exists but isn't available yet
- **Professional Presentation**: "Q2 2025" availability timeline

### Smart Badge Logic

- **Popular Badge**: Only shows on Pro tier (not on Coming Soon tiers)
- **Badge Hierarchy**: Coming Soon badge takes precedence over Popular badge
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Pro tier remains visually emphasized as recommended option

## Database Update Required

To activate these changes, run the SQL script:

```sql
-- Script: scripts/update-business-tier-mvp.sql
UPDATE subscription_tiers
SET
    is_public = true,
    description = 'Enterprise-grade features with priority support (Coming Soon)',
    features = features || '{"mvpStatus": "not_available_during_mvp"}'::json,
    updated_at = now()
WHERE tier_key = 'business';
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Landing Page Architecture

```typescript
interface PricingCardProps {
  tier: SubscriptionTier;
  isPopular?: boolean;
  isComingSoon?: boolean; // New prop for MVP handling
}
```

### MVP Status Detection

```typescript
const isComingSoon =
  (tier.features as any)?.mvpStatus === 'not_available_during_mvp';
const isPopularTier = tier.tierKey === popularTierKey && !isComingSoon;
```

### Upgrade Logic Enhancement

```typescript
const isMVPUnavailable =
  tier.features?.mvpStatus === 'not_available_during_mvp';
const upgradeOptions = tiers.filter(tier => {
  const allowedUpgrades = tier.allowUpgradeFrom as string[];
  return allowedUpgrades.includes(currentTierKey) && !isMVPUnavailable;
});
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Business tier appears on landing page with "Coming Soon" badge
- [x] Business tier appears on billing dashboard with "Coming Soon" badge
- [x] Upgrade buttons are disabled for Business tier
- [x] Consistent "Available Q2 2025" messaging across all locations
- [x] Pro tier remains marked as "Most Popular"
- [x] Visual hierarchy maintained (Pro tier emphasized, Business tier slightly dimmed)
- [x] Type safety maintained across all components
- [x] Database update script created for easy deployment

## Future Considerations

### When Business Tier Launches (Q2 2025)

1. Update database: Remove `mvpStatus` from Business tier features
2. Enable Stripe integration for Business tier pricing
3. Update messaging to remove "Coming Soon" references
4. Test upgrade/downgrade flows thoroughly

### Monitoring

- Track user interest in Business tier (button click analytics)
- Monitor feedback about "Coming Soon" messaging
- Prepare marketing campaigns for Q2 2025 Business tier launch
