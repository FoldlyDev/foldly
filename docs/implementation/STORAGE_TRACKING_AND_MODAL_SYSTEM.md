# Storage Tracking and Modal System Implementation

> **Implementation Date**: January 2025  
> **Status**: ✅ Complete  
> **Impact**: Enhanced user experience with real-time storage tracking and reliable modal management

## Overview

This document covers the implementation of three interconnected systems that significantly improve the Foldly user experience:

1. **Live Storage Tracking System** - Real-time storage usage monitoring during uploads
2. **Billing Integration for Storage** - Dynamic plan detection with storage limits
3. **Modal State Management Fix** - Zustand-based modal management for reliable UI interactions

## 1. Live Storage Tracking System

### Purpose and Benefits

The live storage tracking system provides users with real-time feedback on their storage usage during file uploads. This eliminates the uncertainty of not knowing how much storage is being consumed until after uploads complete.

**Key Benefits:**
- Real-time storage usage updates during uploads
- Predictive usage calculations showing projected final usage
- Per-file upload progress tracking
- Graceful handling of upload failures with automatic rollback

### Architecture Overview

The system is built on a Zustand store that maintains live tracking state separate from the persisted storage data:

```typescript
// Core state structure
interface LiveStorageState {
  baseUsage: number;        // Confirmed usage from server
  uploadingBytes: number;   // Total bytes being uploaded
  completedBytes: number;   // Successfully uploaded bytes
  isUploading: boolean;     // Upload in progress flag
  fileProgress: Map<string, FileProgressInfo>;  // Per-file tracking
}
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **use-live-storage Hook** (`src/features/workspace/hooks/use-live-storage.ts`)

The central hook providing real-time storage calculations:

- **Current Usage**: Base usage + completed uploads
- **Projected Usage**: Current + all files being uploaded
- **Real-time Usage**: Current + weighted progress of active uploads
- **Upload Progress**: Overall percentage across all files

#### 2. **StorageInfoDisplay Enhancement**

The storage display component integrates live tracking to show:
- Static storage info when not uploading
- Dynamic real-time updates during uploads
- Smooth animations for usage changes
- Clear visual feedback on storage limits

### Integration with Uploads

The upload system integrates with live storage tracking through these key touchpoints:

1. **Upload Start**: Register file with `startFileUpload(fileId, totalBytes)`
2. **Progress Updates**: Call `updateFileProgress(fileId, uploadedBytes)` 
3. **Upload Complete**: Mark with `completeFileUpload(fileId)`
4. **Upload Failed**: Rollback with `failFileUpload(fileId)`
5. **All Complete**: Reset with `resetLiveTracking()`

## 2. Billing Integration for Storage

### Dynamic Plan Detection

The billing system now dynamically detects user plans through Clerk integration, providing accurate storage limits:

```typescript
// Plan storage limits
const STORAGE_LIMITS = {
  free: 50 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,      // 50 GB
  pro: 500 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,      // 500 GB  
  business: 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  // 2 TB
};
```

### Integration with Clerk Billing

The `ClerkBillingIntegrationService` provides:

1. **Plan Detection**: Uses Clerk's `has()` helper to check user plans
2. **Feature Access**: Determines available features based on plan
3. **Storage Limits**: Returns appropriate storage limit for user's plan
4. **Upgrade Options**: Provides available upgrade paths

### Storage Limits Per Plan

| Plan | Storage Limit | Monthly Price | Key Features |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Free | 50 GB | $0 | Basic features, email notifications |
| Pro | 500 GB | $29 | Custom branding, password protection |
| Business | 2 TB | $99 | Priority support, advanced analytics |

## 3. Modal State Management Fix

### The Problem

The previous modal system had issues with:
- Modals not opening reliably
- State conflicts between different modal types
- Complex prop drilling for modal control

### The Solution

A dedicated Zustand store for modal management (`files-modal-store.ts`):

```typescript
// Centralized modal control
const useFilesModalStore = create<FilesModalStore>((set) => ({
  activeModal: null,
  modalData: {},
  isModalOpen: false,
  
  openModal: (type, data) => set({
    activeModal: type,
    modalData: data,
    isModalOpen: true
  }),
  
  closeModal: () => set({
    activeModal: null,
    modalData: {},
    isModalOpen: false
  })
}));
```

### Modal Types Supported

- **Upload Modal**: File upload with progress tracking
- **Create Folder Modal**: Folder creation with validation
- **File Details Modal**: View/edit file information
- **Share Modal**: Generate share links with permissions
- **Move/Copy Modal**: File organization operations

### How It Resolves Previous Issues

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One store manages all modal states
2. **Type Safety**: Fully typed modal data and actions
3. **No Prop Drilling**: Components access modal state directly
4. **Consistent API**: Same pattern for all modal types

### Enhanced Upload Modal Features

The upload modal has been significantly enhanced with better user feedback and information display:

#### **Always-Visible Upload Limits and Storage Info**

The modal now **always displays** upload limits and storage information, not just when no files are selected. This provides users with constant awareness of their plan limits and current usage:

- **Upload Limits Info**: Shows file size limits based on subscription plan (Free: 10MB, Pro: 100MB, Business: 500MB)
- **Storage Info Display**: Real-time storage usage with live updates during uploads
- **Persistent Visibility**: Both components remain visible throughout the upload process

#### **Improved File Size Validation**

Real-time validation happens **immediately** when files are selected:

- **Instant Feedback**: Files are validated against plan limits as soon as they're added
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Shows specific files that exceed size limits with their actual sizes
- **Multiple File Handling**: Lists up to 3 files that exceed limits, with a count of additional files if more than 3

Example error display:
```
Files exceeding free plan limit (10 MB):
• large-video.mp4 (125 MB)
• huge-image.png (45 MB)
• big-document.pdf (22 MB)
...and 2 more files
```

#### **Enhanced User Experience Flow**

1. **File Selection**: User selects files via drag-drop or file picker
2. **Immediate Validation**: Files are instantly checked against plan limits
3. **Visual Feedback**: Invalid files highlighted with detailed size information
4. **Upload Prevention**: Upload button disabled if validation fails
5. **Clear Guidance**: Users know exactly which files are too large and what their limit is

## Usage Examples

### Live Storage Tracking

```typescript
// In a component that needs storage info
import { useLiveStorage } from '@/features/workspace/hooks/use-live-storage';

function StorageDisplay() {
  const {
    currentUsage,
    projectedUsage,
    realtimeUsage,
    uploadProgress,
    isUploading
  } = useLiveStorage();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isUploading ? (
        <div>
          <p>Uploading... {uploadProgress.toFixed(0)}%</p>
          <p>Storage: {formatBytes(realtimeUsage)} / {formatBytes(storageLimit)}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Storage: {formatBytes(currentUsage)} / {formatBytes(storageLimit)}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Storage Limits Enforcement

```typescript
// Check if user can upload
import { useUserPlan } from '@/features/workspace/hooks/use-user-plan';

function UploadButton({ fileSize }: { fileSize: number }) {
  const { planKey, storageLimit, storageUsed } = useUserPlan();
  
  const canUpload = (storageUsed + fileSize) <= storageLimit;
  
  if (!canUpload) {
    return (
      <Alert>
        <AlertTitle>Storage Full</AlertTitle>
        <AlertDescription>
          Upgrade to {planKey === 'free' ? 'Pro' : 'Business'} for more storage
        </AlertDescription>
      </Alert>
    );
  }
  
  return <Button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload File</Button>;
}
```

### Modal Management

```typescript
// Opening the upload modal
import { useFilesModalActions } from '@/features/files/store/files-modal-store';

function FilesList() {
  const { openModal } = useFilesModalActions();
  
  const handleUploadClick = () => {
    openModal('upload', {
      targetFolderId: currentFolderId,
      metadata: { source: 'files-list' }
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <Button onClick={handleUploadClick}>
      Upload Files
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoized Calculations**: Live storage values are calculated with `useMemo`
2. **Granular Updates**: Only components using specific values re-render
3. **Debounced Progress**: Upload progress updates are throttled
4. **Efficient State Structure**: Normalized data with Maps for O(1) lookups

### Error Handling

1. **Upload Failures**: Automatic rollback of storage calculations
2. **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation with cached values
3. **Plan Detection Failures**: Safe defaults with warning messages

### Security Considerations

1. **Server Validation**: All storage limits enforced server-side
2. **Clerk Integration**: Secure plan detection through authenticated API
3. **No Client Manipulation**: Storage calculations are display-only

## Future Enhancements

1. **Storage Analytics**: Historical usage trends and predictions
2. **Smart Compression**: Automatic file optimization suggestions
3. **Batch Operations**: Bulk file management with live tracking
4. **Storage Warnings**: Proactive notifications before limits reached
