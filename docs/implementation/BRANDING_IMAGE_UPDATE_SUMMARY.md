## üéØ Key Implementation Details

### Storage Architecture
- **Bucket**: `branding-images`
- **Path**: `{userId}/{linkId}/{filename}`
- **Access**: Public read for display on upload pages
- **Quota**: Separate from user file storage quota

### Upload Process
1. Link created first with branding settings
2. If logo provided, upload happens after link creation
3. URL stored in `brand_image_url` field
4. Logo displayed on public upload pages

### Cleanup Process
- When link deleted, brand image automatically removed
- Prevents storage bloat
- Maintains organized bucket structure
