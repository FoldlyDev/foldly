## 🎯 **Migration Guidelines**

### **Migration Naming Convention**

```
{number}-{descriptive-name}/
├── MIGRATION_TRACKER.md    # Comprehensive migration tracking
├── BEFORE_AFTER.md         # Architecture comparison
└── ROLLBACK_PLAN.md        # Emergency rollback procedures
```

### **Migration Process**

1. **📋 Planning**: Create migration folder and documentation
2. **🔄 Execution**: Follow systematic migration steps with tracking
3. **🧪 Validation**: Run comprehensive tests and build validation
4. **📚 Documentation**: Update all relevant architecture documentation
5. **✅ Completion**: Mark migration as complete with final status

### **Future Migration Categories**
