# 🚀 Foldly Migrations Documentation

> **Migration Management**: Comprehensive documentation for all architectural and infrastructure migrations

## 📋 **Migration Index**

### **Completed Migrations** ✅ (Archived)

All completed architectural migrations have been moved to the archive for reduced maintenance while preserving historical context:

- **📁 Archive Location**: `./archive/`
- **📋 Total Migrations**: 4 major architectural transformations (01-04)
- **🎯 Achievements**: Feature-based architecture, Zustand stores, React Query hybrid, optimal organization
- **📚 Archive Access**: All migration documentation preserved in `./archive/` subdirectories

#### **05 - Database Migration Error Resolution** (January 25, 2025)

- **📁 Location**: `./DATABASE_MIGRATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- **🎯 Objective**: Resolve migration 0009 error and implement migration safety procedures
- **📊 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Migration error resolved, subscription system operational
- **🏗️ Impact**: Database schema drift resolution, 3 new subscription tables, 5 users migrated
- **📚 Documentation**: [DATABASE_MIGRATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./DATABASE_MIGRATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## 🎯 **Migration Guidelines**

### **Migration Naming Convention**

```
{number}-{descriptive-name}/
├── MIGRATION_TRACKER.md    # Comprehensive migration tracking
├── BEFORE_AFTER.md         # Architecture comparison
└── ROLLBACK_PLAN.md        # Emergency rollback procedures
```

### **Migration Process**

1. **📋 Planning**: Create migration folder and documentation
2. **🔄 Execution**: Follow systematic migration steps with tracking
3. **🧪 Validation**: Run comprehensive tests and build validation
4. **📚 Documentation**: Update all relevant architecture documentation
5. **✅ Completion**: Mark migration as complete with final status

### **Future Migration Categories**

- **Architecture Migrations**: Code organization, framework upgrades
- **Database Migrations**: Schema changes, data transformations
- **Infrastructure Migrations**: Deployment, hosting, CI/CD changes
- **Security Migrations**: Authentication, authorization, compliance updates
