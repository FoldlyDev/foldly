## 🔧 Technical Tasks

### Import Updates Required

- [ ] Update imports in components after file moves
- [ ] Update imports in pages/layouts
- [ ] Update test imports
- [ ] Update type imports
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies

### Configuration Updates

- [ ] Update `tsconfig.json` paths if needed
- [ ] Update Jest configuration for new test locations
- [ ] Update linting rules if needed

### Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] ✅ **Updated `docs/TYPE_ARCHITECTURE.md`**:
  - [x] ✅ Updated Type Organization section to reflect feature-based architecture
  - [x] ✅ Updated Import Strategy with feature-specific type imports
  - [x] ✅ Added hybrid approach documentation (global vs feature types)
- [x] ✅ **Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**:

- [x] ✅ **Updated `docs/PLANNING.md`**:
  - [x] ✅ Updated Organization Interface Components section
  - [x] ✅ Reflected current migration status and feature-based structure
  - [x] ✅ Added migration completion status indicators

## 🚨 Migration Notes & Issues

### Decisions Made

- **App folder**: Left untouched as requested - will handle later
- **Global vs Feature-specific**:
  - Global hooks (mobile, scroll) stay in lib
  - Feature hooks move to respective features
  - API types stay global, domain types move to features
- **Styles Migration**: Feature-specific styles move to features, global styles stay in root
- **Component Organization**: Modals, sections, views organized in subdirectories within each feature
- **Empty Folders**: Corrected approach - only create folders when actual files exist (not preemptively)
- **Types Strategy**: Global types (api/, auth/, global/, database/) stay in src/types/, feature-specific types move to features

### Potential Issues to Watch

- [ ] Import path updates across many files
- [ ] Potential circular dependencies
- [ ] Test file imports
- [ ] Type inference issues after moves

### Rollback Plan

- Keep git commits small and focused
- Test after each major migration step
- Maintain backup of current structure

  - `content-loader.css` → ✅ Correctly global (used across auth, dashboard, loading pages)
  - `flip-card.css` → ❌ Feature-specific (only used in landing hero/features sections)
- ✅ **Moved flip-card styles**: `src/styles/components/ui/flip-card.css` → `src/components/features/landing/styles/flip-card.css`
- ✅ **Updated globals.css imports**: Moved flip-card import from Global UI section to Landing Feature section
