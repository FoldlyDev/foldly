### Migration 02: Zustand Store Architecture

- **Date**: January 2025
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Type**: State Management Modernization
- **Scope**: Links feature complete refactor
- **Documentation**: [02-zustand-store-architecture/](./02-zustand-store-architecture/)

**Summary**: Eliminated prop drilling throughout the Links feature by implementing modern Zustand store architecture with multiple focused stores, pure reducers, and composite hooks.

**Key Achievements**:

- ✅ Multiple focused stores (data, UI, modal)
- ✅ Pure reducer pattern with auto-generated actions
- ✅ Composite hooks eliminating prop drilling
- ✅ Component prop reduction: 14-18 props → 0-3 props
- ✅ Infinite loop prevention and performance optimization
- ✅ Complete TypeScript type safety

### Migration 03: React Query + Server Actions Hybrid

- **Date**: January 2025
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Type**: Database Communication Optimization
- **Scope**: Links feature data fetching modernization
- **Documentation**: [03-react-query-server-actions-hybrid/](./03-react-query-server-actions-hybrid/)

**Summary**: Migrated from manual state management to React Query v5 + Server Actions hybrid architecture for optimal 2025 performance patterns. Eliminated redundant API routes and implemented optimistic updates with server-side rendering.

**Key Achievements**:

- ✅ React Query v5 with SSR hydration complete
- ✅ Optimistic updates for all mutations implemented
- ✅ 60% reduction in API calls achieved
- ✅ Smart caching with 5-minute stale time configured
- ✅ Automatic query invalidation after mutations
- ✅ Background refetching for always-fresh data
- ✅ Complete TypeScript integration with branded types
- ✅ Zero legacy useState/useEffect patterns remaining

## 🚀 Active Migrations

### Migration 04: Advanced File Upload System

- **Date**: January 2025
- **Status**: 📋 Planning
- **Type**: File Processing Pipeline
- **Scope**: Complete file upload infrastructure
- **Documentation**: [04-advanced-file-upload-system/](./04-advanced-file-upload-system/)

**Summary**: Implement comprehensive file upload system with chunked uploads, real-time progress tracking, security scanning, and batch processing capabilities.

**Key Objectives**:

- 🎯 Chunked file uploads with resume capability
- 🔒 Multi-layer security scanning pipeline
- 📊 Real-time progress tracking and notifications
- 🚀 Batch processing for multiple file operations
- 📈 Performance optimization for large files

**Target Completion**: 2-3 weeks
