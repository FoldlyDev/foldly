- ‚úÖ Implemented JSON-based feature storage in `subscription_plans` table
- ‚úÖ Established clear separation: Clerk for features, Database for UI metadata
- ‚úÖ Maintained `storage_used` column for performance optimization
- ‚úÖ Added `subscription_analytics` table for business metrics

**Code Reduction Impact**:

- **Files Removed**: 3 complex integration files (650+ lines)
- **Schema Simplified**: 12+ boolean columns ‚Üí JSON-based features
- **Maintainability**: Simple functions replace complex integrations
- **Performance**: Real-time storage calculation with database caching

**New Architecture Benefits**:
