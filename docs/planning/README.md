# Foldly V2 Planning Documentation

This directory contains all planning, architecture, and design documents created before implementation.

## Project Overview

**Foldly V2** is an email-centric collaborative file workspace that allows users to:
- Create shareable folder links for file collection (like Calendly for files)
- Organize and filter files by uploader email across all folders
- Manage multi-person file collection with role-based permissions

**Core Innovation:** Filter all uploaded files by email address across entire workspace, perfect for tax accountants managing 30+ clients, freelancers collecting assets, or HR teams gathering resumes.

**Evolution from V1:**
- V1: Simple file requester (like Dropbox file requests)
- V2: People-centric file organization with email filtering as primary feature
