# Finalized Architectural Decisions

Last Updated: October 8, 2025

## ‚úÖ LOCKED DECISIONS (DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT DISCUSSION)

### 1. Storage Architecture

**Decision:** Single Google Cloud Storage bucket with database-driven logical organization

**Rationale:**
- Simpler architecture
- Database acts as source of truth for all organization
- Avoids storage duplication complexity
- Easier quota management
- GCS handles high storage consumption better than Supabase Storage

**Implementation:**
```
Storage: gs://foldly-files/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {owner_user_id}/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {link_id}/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {file_id}

Database manages:
  - Folder hierarchy
  - Personal vs shared context
  - Permissions
  - Email tagging
  - All logical organization
```

---

### 2. Link-Folder Relationship

**Decision:** Links ARE folders, differentiated with üîó icon in UI

**Rationale:**
- Simpler mental model for users
- Avoids parallel structures
- Folders can fluidly transition between personal ‚Üî shared contexts

**Rules:**
- Every link MUST have a folder
- Folders can exist without links (personal-only)
- Generating a link from a personal folder converts it to shared context
- Decoupling a link makes folder personal again (link becomes inactive)

---

### 3. Permission System

**Decision:** 3-tier role system: Owner / Editor / Uploader

| Role | Email Verification | Can Delete Others' Files | Manage Permissions | Default |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Owner** | N/A | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Link creator |
| **Editor** | ‚úÖ OTP required | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Manually granted |
| **Uploader** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå (own files only) | ‚ùå | Default for new uploaders |

**Editor Promotion Flow:**
1. Owner selects email in access list
2. Promotes to "Editor"
3. System sends OTP to email
4. User verifies via OTP code
5. Editor permissions activated

---

### 4. File Ownership Model

**Decision:** Link owner = absolute file owner

**Rules:**
- All files uploaded through a link belong to the link creator
- All uploads count toward link owner's quota (NOT uploader's quota)
- Uploaders are temporary contributors, not file owners
- When owner deletes a file, it disappears for everyone
- Simpler than Google Drive's multi-owner model

---

### 5. Email Tagging & Filtering

**Decision:** Tag every file with `uploader_email` and `link_id`

**Implementation:**
```sql
files table:
  - uploader_email VARCHAR (indexed)
  - uploader_name VARCHAR (from upload form, metadata only)
  - link_id UUID (indexed)
  - folder_id UUID
```

**Enables:**
- Filter all files by specific email across ALL folders/links
- Filter by email within specific folder
- Filter by email within specific link
- View all uploads from a specific person

**Persistence:**
- Email tags remain even when files move to personal context
- Tags preserved across folder moves
- Historical tracking of who uploaded what

---

### 6. Folder Deletion Behavior

**Decision:** Cascade delete with confirmation dialog

**Flow:**
```
User deletes linked folder ‚Üí
  Confirmation: "This will delete:
    - Folder and all contents
    - Associated link (link becomes inactive)
    - All access permissions
    Continue?"

If confirmed ‚Üí
  Delete folder + contents
  Delete link record
  Delete all permissions
  Notify affected users (optional)
```

---

### 7. Email Access List Management

**Decision:** Lenient model - keep files, block future uploads

**When email removed from access list:**
- ‚úÖ Files uploaded by that email REMAIN in folder
- ‚ùå Future uploads from that email are BLOCKED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Owner can manually delete files if needed

**Rationale:**
- Preserves data continuity
- Avoids accidental data loss
- Owner maintains control

---

### 8. Public Link Behavior

**Decision:** Auto-append first-time uploaders to access list

**Flow:**
1. Public link created
2. New uploader uploads files
3. Email automatically added to access list
4. If link switches to private later ‚Üí that email KEEPS access
5. Owner can manually remove emails if needed

**Rationale:**
- Smoother continuity
- Preserves access when switching contexts
- Owner maintains manual override control

---

### 9. Subfolder Creation

**Decision:** External uploaders CAN create subfolders (based on permissions)

**Rules:**
- **Uploaders:** Can create subfolders, manage own files/folders only
- **Editors:** Can create subfolders, manage ALL files/folders
- **Owner:** Full control over entire hierarchy

**Ownership:**
- Subfolders created by uploaders still belong to link owner
- Count toward owner's quota
- Owner can delete any subfolder regardless of creator

---

### 10. Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

**Backend:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL Database)
- Clerk (Auth + Payments via Stripe)
- Google Cloud Storage (File storage)
- Next.js API Routes / Server Actions

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel (Deployment)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- GCS (File storage)
- Stripe (via Clerk)

---

### 11. Link Types

**Decision:** Two link types only

1. **Public Links**
   - Anyone with link can upload
   - First-time uploaders auto-added to access list
   - Can switch to Dedicated later (preserves existing access)

2. **Dedicated Links**
   - Email-bound (specific emails only)
   - Unauthorized emails blocked
   - Can switch to Public later (opens access)

**Auto-First-Link:**
- On account creation, auto-generate first link (like Calendly)
- Named with username: `foldly.com/{username}`
- User can edit, delete, or create more links

---

### 12. Link URL Structure

**Decision:** Hybrid approach - `foldly.com/{username}/{folder-slug}`

**Structure:**
```
Primary link (auto-generated on signup):
  foldly.com/sarahtax

Additional folder links:
  foldly.com/sarahtax/2024-taxes
  foldly.com/sarahtax/client-work
  foldly.com/sarahtax/john-smith
```

**Implementation:**
- Username must be unique (validated on signup)
- Folder slugs must be unique per user (not globally)
- Auto-generate slug from folder name: "2024 Taxes" ‚Üí "2024-taxes"
- Allow custom slug editing
- URL routing: `/{username}` and `/{username}/{slug}`

**Rationale:**
- Professional and memorable (like Calendly)
- Supports unlimited folders per user (tax accountant with 30 clients)
- Hierarchical and intuitive
- Easy to share verbally: "Go to foldly.com/sarahtax/taxes"
- SEO-friendly (username = personal brand)

---

### 13. Upload Metadata Form

**Decision:** Email required, name optional, profile picture optional

**Upload Form Fields:**
```
Email * (required)
  [john@example.com]

Name (optional)
  [John Smith]

Profile Picture (optional)
  [Upload photo] or [Take photo]

Message (optional)
  [Adding my W-2 and receipts]
```

**Pre-filling Behavior:**
- If user came from email invitation ‚Üí pre-fill email and name from invite
- If user came from direct link ‚Üí empty form
- Allow editing pre-filled values

**Validation:**
- Email format validation (RFC 5322)
- Check against access list if link is Dedicated (private)
- Block upload if email not on access list
- Profile picture: max 5 MB, JPG/PNG only

**Rationale:**
- Email is critical for filtering (core feature)
- Name improves organization and UX
- Profile picture adds personalization
- Low friction (just email is required)

---

### 14. Multi-Folder Email Access

**Decision:** Hybrid model - per-folder permissions with global email tracking

**Database Structure:**
```sql
permissions table:
  - id (primary key)
  - link_id (foreign key ‚Üí links)
  - email (indexed)
  - role (owner/editor/uploader)
  - created_at

Example:
  john@example.com ‚Üí link_1 (2024 Taxes) ‚Üí uploader
  john@example.com ‚Üí link_2 (Client Work) ‚Üí editor
  john@example.com ‚Üí link_3 (Personal) ‚Üí uploader
```

**Filtering Behavior:**
```
"By Email" view:
  Filter: [All Folders ‚ñæ]  [john@example.com ‚ñæ]

Shows all files from john@example.com across all folders:
  üìß john@example.com (15 files across 3 folders)
    ‚îú‚îÄ 2024 Tax Season / W2-Form.pdf (uploader)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Client Work / invoice.pdf (editor)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Personal / receipt.pdf (uploader)

Filter to specific folder:
  Filter: [2024 Tax Season ‚ñæ]

Shows only:
  üìß john@example.com (5 files in 2024 Tax Season)
```

**Rationale:**
- Granular permissions (different roles per folder)
- Global email tracking (cross-folder queries)
- Flexible filtering (all files OR specific folder)
- Supports the "30 clients" use case perfectly

---

### 15. Quota Enforcement

**Decision:** Hard limit at 100% with progressive warnings, NO grace period

**Flow:**
```
Free tier: 2 GB
Pro tier: 50 GB

At 80% (1.6 GB / 40 GB):
  ‚Üí Dashboard warning:
     "‚ö†Ô∏è You're using 80% of your storage. Upgrade to Pro for more space."

At 90% (1.8 GB / 45 GB):
  ‚Üí Dashboard banner:
     "‚ö†Ô∏è Storage almost full! You have 200 MB remaining."

At 100% (2 GB / 50 GB):
  ‚Üí HARD BLOCK
  ‚Üí Dashboard: "‚ùå Storage limit reached. Upgrade to continue receiving uploads."
  ‚Üí Upload page shows: "‚ùå Storage full. Contact the owner to upload files."
  ‚Üí New uploads are rejected
```

**External Uploader Experience:**
- At owner's 0-80%: Upload works, no warnings
- At owner's 80-99%: Upload works, no warnings to uploader
- At owner's 100%: Upload blocked immediately
  - Error message: "This folder's storage is full. Please contact [owner email]."

**Rationale:**
- Clear boundaries, no confusion
- Forces users to manage storage or upgrade
- Prevents unexpected overages
- Simple to implement and understand
- Industry standard for freemium SaaS

---

### 16. Link Sharing Options

**Decision:** Copy link for MVP, advanced sharing for higher tiers

**MVP (Phase 1 - All tiers):**
```
Folder settings:
  üìé Share Link

  [Copy Link]
  ‚úì Link copied to clipboard!

  foldly.com/sarahtax/2024-taxes
```

**Phase 2 (Pro/Team tiers):**
```
Share Link modal:

  Tabs: [Copy] [Email Invite] [QR Code] [Embed]

  [Email Invite]:
    Emails: [john@example.com, jane@company.com]
    Message: [Custom invitation text...]
    [Send Invitations]

  [QR Code]:
    [QR code image]
    [Download PNG]

  [Embed]:
    <iframe src="foldly.com/embed/sarahtax/2024-taxes"></iframe>
    [Copy Code]
```

**Tier Restrictions:**
- Free: Copy link only
- Pro: Copy link + Email invites
- Team: All features (QR, Embed)

**Rationale:**
- MVP focuses on core functionality
- Copy link is sufficient to validate demand
- Advanced sharing as upsell incentive
- Email invites most valuable for power users

---

### 17. UI Layout Style

**Decision:** Google Drive-style grid view with sidebar details panel (NOT tree view)

**Dashboard Layout:**
```

```

**Right-click context menu:**
```
Show details
Open folder

Delete
```

**Folder Icon Badges:**
- üîó badge for shared folders
- "Public" or "Private" label
- People count: "3 people"
- Upload indicator: "‚Ä¢ New uploads"

**Rationale:**
- Familiar UX (everyone knows Google Drive)
- Immediate file visibility (no extra clicks)
- Scalable to thousands of files
- Grid view = easy scanning
- Sidebar details = comprehensive info without navigation
- Context menu = power user shortcuts

---

### 18. Batch Upload Sessions

**Decision:** Skip batching for MVP, add in Phase 2 if requested

**MVP Implementation:**
```sql
files table (no batch_id):
  - id
  - folder_id
  - uploader_email
  - uploader_name
  - link_id
  - filename
  - file_size
  - uploaded_at  ‚Üê Sufficient for chronological grouping
```

**UI Grouping by Time:**
```
üìß john@example.com (15 files)

  Today, 2:30 PM (3 files uploaded together)
  ‚îú‚îÄ W2-Form.pdf
  ‚îú‚îÄ 1099.pdf
  ‚îî‚îÄ Receipts.zip

  Yesterday, 4:15 PM (2 files)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Contract.pdf
  ‚îî‚îÄ Invoice.pdf
```

**Rationale:**
- Simpler database schema
- Email grouping already provides organization
- Timestamp grouping provides implicit sessions
- Can add `batch_id` later if users request explicit session tracking
- Reduces MVP complexity

**Future Batching Benefits (Phase 2):**
- Explicit "upload session" grouping in UI
- Batch operations (delete session, download session as ZIP)
- Session-level metadata (notes, tags)
- Better tracking for multi-file uploads

---

### 19. Email Repositories Concept

**Decision:** Email repositories are linked folders optimized for single-person file collection

**Technical Reality:**
- Email repositories = linked folders (same database tables, same functionality)
- No separate implementation or data structure
- "Email repository" is a UX concept, not a technical distinction

**User Workflows:**

**Workflow 1: Personal Folder**
```
[+ New Folder] ‚Üí
  Creates folder WITHOUT link (personal storage)
  User can optionally generate link later
  Use case: Private files, drafts, personal organization
```

**Workflow 2: File Collection (Email Repository)**
```
[+ Request Files] ‚Üí
  Creates folder WITH link automatically
  Pre-configured for receiving uploads
  Use case: Collecting files from others
```

**Rationale:**
- Clear mental model: Personal vs Shared
- Same backend, different creation paths
- Optimized UX for common use cases

**Note:** "Request Files" is the chosen UI label (subject to refinement during design phase)

---

### 20. Folder Naming Convention

**Decision:** User-defined folder names (never auto-update)

**Folder Creation Flow:**
```
Creating email repository for john@example.com:

Modal:
  Email: [john@example.com]

  Folder name: [john@example.com]  ‚Üê Default suggestion, fully editable

  Slug: [john-at-example-com]  ‚Üê Auto-generated from folder name

  [Create]
```

**Folder Name Control:**
- User types folder name (or accepts default)
- Folder name NEVER auto-updates
- Email tracked in database for filtering
- Uploader name captured as metadata (not used for folder naming)

**Suggested Naming Patterns (shown as UI hint):**
- Person's name: "John Smith"
- Company name: "Acme Corp"
- Project context: "Client - 2024 Taxes"
- Email as fallback: "john@example.com"

**Database Structure:**
```sql
folders:
  - id
  - name (user-defined, immutable unless manually changed)
  - slug (generated from name)
  - owner_id

files:
  - uploader_email (tracked for filtering)
  - uploader_name (metadata only, from upload form)
```

**Rationale:**
- User has full control (no surprises)
- Prevents inappropriate auto-naming
- Email filtering works independently of folder names
- Clean separation of concerns

---

### 21. Dashboard Tab Naming

**Decision:** "Files" as default view tab name

**Tab Structure:**
```
[Files] [By Email] [By Date]
 ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
 Default
```

**Tab Descriptions:**

**[Files]:**
- Shows user's root-level folders and files (Google Drive-style grid layout)
- Immediate visibility of all items
- Click folder ‚Üí navigate inside
- Click file ‚Üí open sidebar details

**[By Email]:**
- Groups all files by uploader email
- Cross-folder filtering
- Perfect for "show me all files from john@example.com"

**[By Date]:**
- Chronological file list
- Recent activity tracking

**Rationale:**
- "Files" is clean, simple, and professional
- Clearly describes the view without being derivative
- Works for both casual and business users
- Avoids confusion with other navigation patterns

**Alternatives Considered:**
- "My Drive" - Too similar to Google Drive
- "All Files" - Clear but slightly generic
- "My Space" - Too casual for business use
- "All" - Too vague (all what?)
