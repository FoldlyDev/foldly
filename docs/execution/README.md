## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

| Component | Status | Location | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Database Schema** | ✅ Completed | `database/schema.md` | 6 tables implemented with Drizzle ORM |
| Next.js Project | ⏳ Pending | - | Base setup needed |
| Supabase Config | ⏳ Pending | - | Database connection |
| GCS Setup | ⏳ Pending | - | Storage bucket configuration |
| Clerk Auth | ⏳ Pending | - | Authentication integration |
| Base UI Components | ⏳ Pending | - | shadcn/ui setup |

## Completed Features

### ✅ Database Schema (October 8, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/lib/database/schemas/users.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/workspaces.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/links.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/folders.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/files.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/permissions.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/index.ts`
- `drizzle/schema.ts`

**Key Features**:
- 1:1 workspace-user relationship (MVP)
- Globally unique link slugs
- Hierarchical folder structure
- Email-centric file filtering
- Nullable uploader tracking (owner vs external)
- Flat GCS storage architecture

**Next Steps**:
1. Generate migrations: `pnpm drizzle-kit generate`
2. Push to database: `pnpm drizzle-kit push`
3. Implement Clerk webhook for auto-generation flow

**Documentation**: [Database Schema Spec](./database/schema.md)

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Developers

1. **Check implementation status** in the tables above
2. **Read detailed specs** in subdirectories (database/, api/, components/)
3. **Update docs** as you implement features
4. **Mark items complete** when deployed/merged

### For Product/Design

1. Compare against [Planning Docs](../planning) to see what's been built
2. Check implementation status for feature availability
3. Review specs to understand technical constraints

---

## Documentation Guidelines

When implementing a new feature:

1. ✅ Create detailed spec document in appropriate subdirectory
2. ✅ Update implementation status table above
3. ✅ Add migration history entry (if database changes)
4. ✅ Document any deviations from original plan
5. ✅ Include code location references
6. ✅ Update testing status
