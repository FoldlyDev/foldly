- Onboarding: `checkOnboardingStatus()`, `checkUsernameAvailability()`
- Permission Queries: `getPermissionsByLink()`, `createPermission()`, etc.
- Client Hooks: `useOnboardingStatus()`, `useUserWorkspace()`, `useCreateWorkspace()`

**Status**:
- ✅ Database queries layer implemented

### ✅ Onboarding Flow (October 11, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:

4. Create first link with owner permission
5. Sync username to Clerk (last step for rollback safety)

**Status**:
- ✅ Multi-step loader with 4 progress stages
- ✅ Username pre-fill from Clerk if provided during signup
