## Completed Features

### ✅ Database Schema & Migration (October 9, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/lib/database/schemas/users.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/workspaces.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/links.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/folders.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/files.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/permissions.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/index.ts`
- `drizzle/schema.ts`
- `drizzle/0000_superb_sway.sql`

**Key Features**:
- 1:1 workspace-user relationship (MVP)
- Globally unique link slugs
- Hierarchical folder structure
- Email-centric file filtering
- Nullable uploader tracking (owner vs external)
- Flat GCS storage architecture

**Status**:
- ✅ Schemas implemented in Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Migration generated
- ✅ Schema pushed to Supabase (all 6 tables active)

**Documentation**: [Database Schema Spec](./database/schema.md)

### ✅ Global Actions & Hooks Layer (October 9, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/lib/database/queries/workspace.queries.ts`
- `src/lib/database/queries/user.queries.ts`
- `src/lib/database/queries/permission.queries.ts`
- `src/lib/database/queries/index.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/onboarding.actions.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/workspace.actions.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/user.actions.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/index.ts`
- `src/hooks/data/use-onboarding-status.ts`
- `src/hooks/data/use-user-workspace.ts`
- `src/hooks/data/index.ts`
- `src/hooks/ui/use-scroll-position.ts`
- `src/hooks/ui/index.ts`
- `src/hooks/index.ts`

**Implemented Patterns**:
- Three-layer architecture: Client → Hooks → Actions → Queries
- Database queries layer for reusable operations
- Global server actions for cross-module functionality
- React Query hooks wrapping server actions
- Organized hooks structure (`data/` and `ui/` subdirectories)

**Cross-Module Functionality**:
- User Management: `createUserAction()`, `getUserAction()`, `updateUserProfileAction()`
- Workspace Operations: `getUserWorkspaceAction()`, `createUserWorkspaceAction()`
- Onboarding: `checkOnboardingStatus()`, `checkUsernameAvailability()`
- Permission Queries: `getPermissionsByLink()`, `createPermission()`, etc.
- Client Hooks: `useOnboardingStatus()`, `useUserWorkspace()`, `useCreateWorkspace()`

**Status**:
- ✅ Database queries layer implemented
- ✅ Global server actions created
- ✅ Global hooks layer established
- ✅ Broken imports fixed across codebase
- ✅ Type-checked and verified

---

### ✅ Onboarding Flow (October 11, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/modules/auth/components/forms/OnboardingForm.tsx`
- `src/app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- 4-step onboarding process with visual feedback
- Username availability checking with Clerk reverification
- Database user creation before workspace (foreign key dependency)
- Automatic workspace and first link creation
- Server-side completion check (redirects if already onboarded)
- Form validation with disabled state management

**Onboarding Flow**:
1. Check username availability in Clerk (with reverification)
2. Create user in database (required for foreign key)
3. Create workspace with auto-generated name
4. Create first link with owner permission
5. Sync username to Clerk (last step for rollback safety)

**Status**:
- ✅ Multi-step loader with 4 progress stages
- ✅ Username pre-fill from Clerk if provided during signup
- ✅ Submit button disabled when field empty or validation fails
- ✅ Server-side onboarding check implemented
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Developers

1. **Check implementation status** in the tables above
2. **Read detailed specs** in subdirectories (database/, api/, components/)
3. **Update docs** as you implement features
4. **Mark items complete** when deployed/merged

### For Product/Design

1. Compare against [Planning Docs](../planning) to see what's been built
2. Check implementation status for feature availability
3. Review specs to understand technical constraints

---

## Documentation Guidelines

When implementing a new feature:

1. ✅ Create detailed spec document in appropriate subdirectory
2. ✅ Update implementation status table above
3. ✅ Add migration history entry (if database changes)
4. ✅ Document any deviations from original plan
5. ✅ Include code location references
6. ✅ Update testing status
