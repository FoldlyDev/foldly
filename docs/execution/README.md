## Completed Features

### ✅ Database Schema & Migration (October 9, 2025)

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/lib/database/schemas/users.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/workspaces.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/links.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/folders.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/files.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/permissions.ts`
- `src/lib/database/schemas/index.ts`
- `drizzle/schema.ts`
- `drizzle/0000_superb_sway.sql`

**Key Features**:
- 1:1 workspace-user relationship (MVP)
- Globally unique link slugs
- Hierarchical folder structure
- Email-centric file filtering
- Nullable uploader tracking (owner vs external)
- Flat GCS storage architecture

**Status**:
- ✅ Schemas implemented in Drizzle ORM

- ✅ Schema pushed to Supabase (all 6 tables active)

**Next Steps**:
1. Build onboarding flow to capture username and trigger user auto-generation
2. Set up Google Cloud Storage bucket
3. Implement base UI components (shadcn/ui)

**Documentation**: [Database Schema Spec](./database/schema.md)

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Developers

1. **Check implementation status** in the tables above
2. **Read detailed specs** in subdirectories (database/, api/, components/)
3. **Update docs** as you implement features
4. **Mark items complete** when deployed/merged

### For Product/Design

1. Compare against [Planning Docs](../planning) to see what's been built
2. Check implementation status for feature availability
3. Review specs to understand technical constraints

---

## Documentation Guidelines

When implementing a new feature:

1. ✅ Create detailed spec document in appropriate subdirectory
2. ✅ Update implementation status table above
3. ✅ Add migration history entry (if database changes)
4. ✅ Document any deviations from original plan
5. ✅ Include code location references
6. ✅ Update testing status
